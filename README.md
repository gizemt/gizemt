### Hi there, I'm Gizem ðŸ‘‹

I've spent some time working with signal processing and machine learning. My interests range from audio processing to biomedical sensing and acoustic wireless communications.

- ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm working on some super cool audio machine learning projects at work.
- ðŸŒ± I'm eager to learn more about contributing to open-source and bringing machine learning systems into real-world use.
- ðŸ¤“ I'm on the lookout for a paper reading&coding group on audio ML and/or LLMs. Let's connect if you're aware of one or are interested in setting up a new one!

Below a glimpse of my previous works, primarily from my time in grad school. For a closer look, feel free to visit [my personal webpage](https://gizemtabak.com) or [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gizem-tabak/).
