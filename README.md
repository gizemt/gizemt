### Hi there, I'm Gizem ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD candidate at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research is in signal processing and machine learning with applications on audio processing, biomedical sensing and acoustic wireless communications. I like solving puzzles, listening to stuff and being outdoors. 

In this GitHub repo, I have some examples of my work in audio processing and machine learning. For more projects and publications, you can check out
